Welcome to Rove's documentation!
===================================

**Rove** is an interactive bus transit performance analysis tool developed by the MIT Transit Lab.

ROVE is intended to be a flexible and user-friendly dashboard to visualize and compare the performance
| of a bus network over time. It is generalizable so that it can be easily adapted to different networks.
| It includes performance metrics related to scheduled supply, actual supply and passenger loading, based 
| on the data available from the agency. It can be used for service planning, scheduling, detour
| planning and many other applications. It is *browser-based*, and therefore does not require any special
| software or advanced technical knowledge on the part of the end user.
