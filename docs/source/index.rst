Welcome to Rove's documentation!
===================================

**ROVE** is an interactive bus transit performance analysis tool developed by the MIT Transit Lab.

ROVE is intended to be a flexible and user-friendly dashboard to visualize and compare the performance 
of a bus network over time. It is generalizable so that it can be easily adapted to different networks. 
It includes performance metrics related to scheduled supply, actual supply and passenger loading, based 
on the data available from the agency. It can be used for service planning, scheduling, detour 
planning and many other applications. It is *browser-based*, and therefore does not require any special 
software or advanced technical knowledge on the part of the end user.

Check out the :doc:`install` section for further information.

.. note::

   The current implementation of ROVE provides stable support for static GTFS data only. 
   Users wishing to display observed metrics calculated with AVL data may do so at your own discretion.
